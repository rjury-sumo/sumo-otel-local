Sumo OTEL Collector Local Bootstrapper for MacOS

## About

A quick method for testing the Sumo OTEL Collector using a local KinD Cluster. The cluster configuration creates a `3` node cluster which is sufficient for the
Sumo OTEL Collector to install and for the user to validate configuration settings.

## Basic Usage

Clone this repo and run the script

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bradtho/sumo-otel-local.git
cd sumo-otel-local
chmod +x sumo-otel-local.sh
./sumo-otel-local.sh -i
```

Follow the in-script prompts.

For additional options use the `help` function

```bash
./sumo-otel-local.sh -h
Usage: ./sumo-otel-local.sh [options]
Options:
    -h, --help      Display this help message.
    -i, --install   Install the dependencies and setup the Sumo Operator.
    -n, --init      Install dependencies without setting up the Sumo Operator.
    -m, --helm      Install Sumo Operator onto existing cluster.
    -o, --output    Output the rendered Kubernetes manifest YAML file.
    -p, --purge     Uninstall the Cluster and Podman Machine.
    -u, --uninstall Uninstall the Cluster only.
    -v, --version   Display the version of the script.
```

## Advanced (Sandpit)

The `examples` folder contains a curated list of advanced implementation methods. Instructions for these are in the [README](./examples/README.md) file in that folder.

## Caveat

To run on the Docker/Podman Virtual Machine the `--set sumologic.logs.systemd.enabled=false` had to be set as these systems don't write to the JournalD and will cause the installation to fail.

## Editing and Advanced

Instructions on how to amend the `kind-config.yaml` file are available on the [KinD website](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#getting-started)

You may wish to create a Helm Configuration `values.yaml` file or to amend the `--set` and/or `--set-string` entries in the `install.sh` script.

## Contributing

This was always intended to be a basic bootstrapping script. However feel free to raise a PR or an issue and I'll get valid ideas incorporated.
